ML Ops - Arrikto, Kubeflow and Kubernetes (K8s). 
>At the core of Arrikto is Kubeflow, the Google-incubated open-source machine learning toolkit for Kubernetes — and in many ways, you can think of Arrikto as offering an enterprise-ready version of Kubeflow. Among other projects, the team also built MiniKF to run Kubeflow on a laptop and uses Kale, which lets engineers build Kubeflow pipelines from their JupyterLab notebooks. Founder - Venetsanopoulos noted that just like Kubernetes showed businesses what a simple and scalable infrastructure could look like, Arrikto can show them what a simpler ML production pipeline can look like — and do so in a Kubernetes-native way.

A Chat with Andrew on MLOps: From Model-centric to Data-centric AI 
- Improve quality of data rather than focusing on solely on model.
- While improving data, make sure labelers follow consistent labelling to get most out of the model. In below example one labeler labeled bounding box around each defect, whereas other labeler grouped them. This will confuse the model. Better approach is to identify these problems with labelers and have consistency across.
- ML Ops plays key role in ML project lifecycle - MLOps tools to make data-centric ai an efficient and systamatic process.

#### 05/07/2021 Fri (Day 8)

ML Ops Community site has nicely curated content. https://mlops.community/. Below is their latest newsletter - 
https://autodb.activehosted.com/index.php?action=social&chash=6974ce5ac660610b44d9b9fed0ff9548.122&s=30a202ca5addb3aecc7727a23287b37f

One of the recent ML Ops Community Meetup is with Guest Speaker Daniel Stahl, Model Platforms Manager at Regions Bank - "Operationalizing Machine Learning at a Large Financial Institution" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrvagiFVzI4

TL;DR (Just first 12 mins of video :)
- Regions Bank 
	- Not really using latest and greatest tech stack, but still getting high deployment success rate.

- Stack 
	On Prem Hadoop based DataLake - Serves as underpinning for all Analytics
	Cloudera DataScience WorkBench - Way to interact with DataLake
	Jupyter Notebook - Simple and familiar IDE to connect and interact with Big Data cluster
	Apache Spark - Data Engineering, Model Training
	Dev Ops 
	- BitBucket for GIT version control
	- Bamboo for CI/CD
	
- Went with the metality that conceptually both Software dev and ML training are similar (10:00min), with the assumption that ML has additional complexities like large data volume and computational need. (Per speaker not many accept this, but he still feels this works)
	- Training Pipeline - Takes Feature engineering/model code and outputs a trained model (pikcle serialized object or other object. What is Pickle?? More on this later).
	- Scoring Pipeline - Takes Model and creates predictions
	- Monitoring Pipeline - Compare Training and Scoring Pipeline prediction performance
	
	
Phew!!! thats first 12 mins of video. More later.

Me: Trying to consume ML info. How hard can it be? <br>
